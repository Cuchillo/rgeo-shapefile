{"name":"RGeo::Shapefile","body":"[RGeo](http://dazuma.github.com/rgeo) is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the Ruby programming language. At its core is an implementation of the industry standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons, along with a set of geometric analysis operation.\r\n\r\nRGeo::Shapefile is an optional RGeo add-on module for reading geospatial data from ESRI shapefiles. The shapefile format is a common file format used for sharing geospatial data sets. It is specified in\r\n[this ESRI whitepaper](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'rgeo/shapefile'\r\n \r\nRGeo::Shapefile::Reader.open('myshpfil.shp') do |file|\r\n  puts \"File contains #{file.num_records} records.\"\r\n  file.each do |record|\r\n    puts \"Record number #{record.index}:\"\r\n    puts \"  Geometry: #{record.geometry.as_text}\"\r\n    puts \"  Attributes: #{record.attributes.inspect}\"\r\n  end\r\n  file.rewind\r\n  record = file.next\r\n  puts \"First record geometry was: #{record.geometry.as_text}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\n* See the [documentation](http://dazuma.github.com/rgeo-shapefile/rdoc)\r\n* Source code on [Github](http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo-shapefile)\r\n* Report issues [here](http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo-shapefile/issues)\r\n* Questions?
