=== 0.2.0 / 2010-12-07

* Initial public alpha release. Spun rgeo-shapefile off from the core rgeo gem.
* Removed the :default_factory option, for consistency with the other modules.
* Several reader methods didn't properly check if the file was still opened. Fixed.

For earlier history, see the History file for the rgeo gem.
